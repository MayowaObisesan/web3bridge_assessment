## WEB3BRIDGE TODO ASSESSMENT REPO

The HTML, JavaScript and CSS are contained within the index.html file.

_I decided to leave it in a single file to avoid the extra fetch time, though it won't matter in this case._

The implementation is documented as needed within the code.

This is a simple implementation based on the instruction contained in the PDF containing the task.
I added a little bit of extra though, for the User Experience. 

- Checked against submitting an empty todo task
- Added an extra count operation to the number of todo tasks.

This task was deployed using Vercel.
